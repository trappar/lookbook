You don't need to do anything special to see your ViewComponent previews in Lookbook - just create them as normal and they'll automatically appear in the Lookbook UI. Preview templates, custom layouts and even bespoke [preview controllers](https://viewcomponent.org/guide/previews.html#configuring-preview-controller) should all work as you would expect.

If you are new to ViewComponent development you should first read the ViewComponent docs on [creating previews](https://viewcomponent.org/guide/previews.html) as Lookbook uses these same files.
